## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an end-to-end **Sales & Demand Forecasting System** using historical business data. 

Accurate demand prediction helps enterprises optimize inventory management, improve supply chain efficiency, and minimize operational costs. This project implements advanced **time-series feature engineering**—extracting calendar components, lag features, and rolling statistics—paired with an **XGBoost Regressor** to deliver precise sales forecasts.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Build a machine learning regression pipeline for time-series forecasting.
* Engineer lag variables ($t-1$, $t-7$, $t-30$) and rolling window statistics.
* Evaluate predictive performance using standard metrics ($RMSE$, $MAE$, $R^2$).
* Generate business-ready visualization plots comparing actual vs. forecasted sales.
* Save trained model artifacts for future deployment.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🤖 **XGBoost Regression Model**: Captures complex non-linear trends and seasonal patterns.
* ⏱️ **Time-Based Feature Extraction**: Automatically derives day, month, year, day of week, and weekend flags.
* 📉 **Lag & Rolling Window Features**: Captures historic sales momentum and trend smoothing.
* 📊 **Business Visualizations**: Generates clean plots comparing actual vs. predicted sales.
* 💾 **Model Persistence**: Saves trained model as a `.pkl` file for modular inference.
